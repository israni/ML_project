We implement two RL algorithms- DQN and A2C on Atari Breakout (part of AI gym - a game that is usually used as a testbed to evaluate various RL algorithms). We prvide an easy to understand and mathematically complete description of these algorithms in the report. 
The results of learning with both the RL algorithms playing the game at different levels of training are provided in the video (provided above) and a discussion of the results is present in the Final Report.

Motivation -

While supervised learning takes many forms and solves a wide variety of problems, they are fundamentally constrained by the fact that there exists prior knowledge of deterministic input-output pairs. However, in many real-world situations, like traffic control, stock market predictions and robotics, such an optimistic assumption usually does not hold. 

Being students in Robotics, we wanted to implement something that could tackle these problems and also help us learn algorithms which we could use after joining the industry on Robotic platforms. Reinforcement learning (RL) is modelled after the idea that oneâ€™s action is not immediately rewarded. Unlike supervised learning, RL algorithms learn from a reward that is noisy, sparse and time-delayed. 
As such, it has become a standard in many fields, such as robotics [1], chemistry [2], and video games [3] and implementing it on the Atari Breakout game has given us great insight on how to use RL on different types of datasets along with the potential causes of failure.

The videos that are shared are probably our obtained after several trials and failures, but it finally worked! Hope you enjoy it!

To start training: 0. Go to the relevant directory

    Push the existing models onto git: <git add .> <git commit -m "models ___">
    Move to dqn directory:
    Delete the models in the instance <sudo rm -r models>
    Change the screen using <screen -S training>
    Run trainDQN with sudo permission in python3 .
    Press ctrl+a+d to detach this screen. This will remove the screen you are seeing and show you the screen 0
    To go back to the training screen use <screen -r>
